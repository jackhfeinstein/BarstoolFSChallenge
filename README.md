# The Barstool Fullstack Boxscore Challenge

My take on the Barstool fullstack challenge (https://github.com/BarstoolSports/fullstack-challenge)

Task included:
 - Creating an API that would return cached or fresh data based on when the most recent call was.
 - Creating a frontend application with react to represent a boxscore widget on a sports website.

The code to both the frontend and backend/server applications for this project can be found in their respective directories, along with their own README files which will explain how to get each application up and running.

Viva La Stool!
