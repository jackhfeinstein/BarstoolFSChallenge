# Front end React application for the Barstool Fullstack Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get the application started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It is recommended that this is run after the server is up and running, otherwise the call to the API will not work

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
